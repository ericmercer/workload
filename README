STEPS TO FULLY RUN PROGRAM

1) CREATE TEXT FILES OF SCENARIO
	a) Create a separate text file for each actor in the scenario
	b) follow this format for each transition(write everything in all caps):
		 Transition := (CurrentState,[Channel=InputData*],[Memory{=||>||<...}InputValue*],Priority,Duration,Probability)x(NextState,[Channel=OutputData*],[Memory=OutputValue*], Transition_Description)
		
2) CREATE/UPDATE NECESSARY HEADER FILES
	a) In model.scaffold, include a Header.h file listing all actors abbreviations used in in/out channels and their file name; only one actor per line
		i.e. AL Alice
	b) In model, include a Header.h file where you list all actors to be ran in simulation and then all the graphs you want to have created
		
3) RUN INTERPRETER
	a) Make sure all text files of the actors in the scenario are in the model.scaffold package
	b) Make sure Header.h file in model.scaffold
	c) Run Interpreter.java

4) RUN WISARMODEL
	a) Make sure Header.h file is in model package
	b) Make sure WiSARModel.jpf file is in model package with correct file paths
	b) To run WISARModel using JPF, make sure line 20 has RunsJPF.YES
		- In order to create graphs, JPF must be set to NO
	c) To run WISARModel without using JPF, make sure line 20 has RunsJPF.NO
	d) Run WISARModel.java
